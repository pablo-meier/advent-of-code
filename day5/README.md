# Day 5

## Problem description

> You are faced with a security door designed by Easter Bunny engineers that seem
> to have acquired most of their security knowledge by watching hacking movies.
> 
> The eight-character password for the door is generated one character at a time
> by finding the MD5 hash of some Door ID (your puzzle input) and an increasing
> integer index (starting with 0).
> 
> A hash indicates the next character in the password if its hexadecimal
> representation starts with five zeroes. If it does, the sixth character in the
> hash is the next character of the password.
> 
> For example, if the Door ID is abc:
> 
> * The first index which produces a hash that starts with five zeroes is
>   `3231929`, which we find by hashing `abc3231929`; the sixth character of the
>   hash, and thus the first character of the password, is 1.
> * `5017308` produces the next interesting hash, which starts with
>   `000008f82`..., so the second character of the password is 8.
> * The third time a hash starts with five zeroes is for `abc5278568`,
>   discovering the character f.
> * In this example, after continuing this search a total of eight times, the
>   password is `18f47a30`.
> 
> Given the actual Door ID, what is the password?

## Solution

## How to run

Make sure you have [Go][1] installed on your machine, with the command
`go` in your `PATH`, or aliased to its position. Then:

`make`

## Details

### Part 1

Using Go because it's simple to calculate an MD5 for values. Want to use C
soonâ€¦

First shot is naively start from 0 and calculate a bunch of hashes. While md5s
are pretty speedy, I wonder how long we're gonna end up waiting.

### Part 2

Mostly the same, we just have to go that much higher. Clever need to error check
the string-to-int code.
