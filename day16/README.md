# Day 16

## Problem description

> You're done scanning this part of the network, but you've left traces of your
> presence. You need to overwrite some disks with random-looking data to cover
> your tracks and update the local security system with a new checksum for those
> disks.
> 
> For the data to not be suspicious, it needs to have certain properties; purely
> random data will be detected as tampering. To generate appropriate random data,
> you'll need to use a modified dragon curve.
> 
> Start with an appropriate initial state (your puzzle input). Then, so long as
> you don't have enough data yet to fill the disk, repeat the following steps:
> 
> * Call the data you have at this point "a".
> * Make a copy of "a"; call this copy "b".
> * Reverse the order of the characters in "b".
> * In "b", replace all instances of 0 with 1 and all 1s with 0.
> * The resulting data is "a", then a single 0, then "b".
> 
> For example, after a single step of this process,
> 
> * `1` becomes `100`.
> * `0` becomes `001`.
> * `11111` becomes `11111000000`.
> * `111100001010` becomes `1111000010100101011110000`.
> 
> Repeat these steps until you have enough data to fill the desired disk.
> 
> Once the data has been generated, you also need to create a checksum of that
> data. Calculate the checksum only for the data that fits on the disk, even if
> you generated more data than that in the previous step.
> 
> The checksum for some given data is created by considering each non-overlapping
> pair of characters in the input data. If the two characters match (00 or 11),
> the next checksum character is a 1. If the characters do not match (01 or 10),
> the next checksum character is a 0. This should produce a new string which is
> exactly half as long as the original. If the length of the checksum is even,
> repeat the process until you end up with a checksum with an odd length.
> 
> For example, suppose we want to fill a disk of length 12, and when we finally
> generate a string of at least length 12, the first 12 characters are
> `110010110100`. To generate its checksum:
> 
> * Consider each pair: 11, 00, 10, 11, 01, 00.
> * These are same, same, different, same, different, same, producing 110101.
> * The resulting string has length 6, which is even, so we repeat the process.
> * The pairs are 11 (same), 01 (different), 01 (different).
> * This produces the checksum 100, which has an odd length, so we stop.
> 
> Therefore, the checksum for 110010110100 is 100.
> 
> Combining all of these steps together, suppose you want to fill a disk of length
> 20 using an initial state of 10000:
> 
> * Because 10000 is too short, we first use the modified dragon curve to make it
>   longer.
> * After one round, it becomes 10000011110 (11 characters), still too short.
> * After two rounds, it becomes 10000011110010000111110 (23 characters), which
>   is enough.
> * Since we only need 20, but we have 23, we get rid of all but the first 20
>   characters: 10000011110010000111.
> * Next, we start calculating the checksum; after one round, we have 0111110101,
>   which 10 characters long (even), so we continue.
> * After two rounds, we have 01100, which is 5 characters long (odd), so we are
>   done.
> 
> In this example, the correct checksum would therefore be 01100.
> 
> The first disk you have to fill has length 272. Using the initial state in your
> puzzle input, what is the correct checksum?

## Solution

## How to run

So, this was a departure! I tried using the new up-and-comer, [Pyret][1], and
developed Part 1 in the [online editor][2]. Part 2, however, blew Node's memory
limits, even when run locally (which, if you [read how to on the GitHub repo][3],
isn't totally trivialâ€¦). I even [increased Node's memory to 4GB][4] and still
blew it, soâ€¦

I re-wrote it in OCaml. You know what's cool? Many of the functions in [OCaml's
Lists][5] aren't tail recursive and will blow your stack! Cooooooooooool. There's
totally a good reason why that must be the case, he said out loud.

Ensure you have `ocamlopt` on your machine, then

`make`

## Part 1

Naive: do the things it describes.

## Part 2

Same, just re-write standard library functions in a compiled language ðŸ˜›

(there's probably a think-ey way to be smarter about this, but I didn't feel
like doing it).
